# Super_Worker
## Preface

  This project was launched on 2023-2-14, it was inspired by a game named "å¤§å¤šæ•°" on Steam. Of course, the content is thought by myself except for the game model. Recently, I was busy with the junior middle school graduated exam, and I will hardly update the code within half a year (no one will watch it anyway ðŸ˜…ï¼‰ï¼Œ But when I am free, I will try to design the game. I really don't know what to say (I didn't say anything actually as well)
  This game can be extended. It means that after I finish the first version, you can apply for a new branch and then write mods by changing the source codes directly or using the ** Module making tool ** that I have made. But all of them is not ready now.
